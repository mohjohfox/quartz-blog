Welcome to my website! I'm Marco, and I'm currently studying computer science at DHBW in Karlsruhe. I have a focus on theoretical computer science and software architecture. As a passionate programmer, I have expertise in a variety of programming languages, including Java, Kotlin, Typescript, and Python.

I enjoy keeping up with the latest developments in the IT industry and expanding my knowledge. On my website, I will be regularly publishing articles and posts where I share my experiences, knowledge, and ideas. So if you're interested in topics like programming, theoretical computer science, and software architecture, you've come to the right place.

I invite you to explore my website and connect with me. I look forward to hearing from you and discussing your thoughts and questions on these exciting topics.
