### [SimpleTactics Website](https:/simpletactics.de)
The SimpleTactics website, is a site developed together with friends. It helps us to plan and organize various internal events. The frontend is based on Angular. The backend is implemented in Java with SpringBoot. 

### [Darttracker for DHBW Karlsruhe](https://github.com/mohjohfox/GitGood-backend)
The Darttracker is currently being developed for a project at the DHBW Karlsruhe. The website should be a help for different dart games. It will be possible to choose between different games. Via a user interface the thrown points will be entered and evaluated. The project is divided into frontend, which is realized in Angular and backend, which is built on Java in combination with SpringBoot.

### [Automatic Generation and Validation of Exercise Problems for Type-2 Grammars and Pushdown Automata](https://github.com/rhyperio/studienarbeit_code)
The topic focuses on the automatic generation and validation of exercise problems for Type-2 grammars and pushdown automata. Type-2 grammars are a formal language class that describes context-free languages, while pushdown automata are computational devices used to recognize context-free languages. The aim is to develop a system or algorithm that can automatically create a variety of exercise problems related to these concepts. Additionally, the system should be able to validate the correctness of the generated problems, ensuring they align with the desired specifications and constraints. This approach aims to facilitate the learning and understanding of Type-2 grammars and pushdown automata by providing students with a diverse set of practice exercises and immediate feedback on their solutions.
